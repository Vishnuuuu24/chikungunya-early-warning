FIGURE: Calibration Curves (Placeholder)
============================================================

WHAT IS SHOWN:
Reliability diagram showing predicted probability vs observed outbreak fraction for XGBoost (and optionally Bayesian posterior predictive probability).

WHY IT MATTERS:
Points above the diagonal indicate underconfidence (observed rate higher than predicted). Points below indicate overconfidence. Perfect calibration lies on diagonal.

CAVEATS:
Placeholder - requires stored prediction probabilities. Bayesian model outputs risk Z_t, not probability; calibration interpretation differs.
