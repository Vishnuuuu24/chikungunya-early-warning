FIGURE: Differential Lead Time (ΔL) Distribution
============================================================

WHAT IS SHOWN:
Histogram of ΔL = L_XGB - L_Bayes for episodes where both models triggered. Positive ΔL means Bayesian warned earlier.

WHY IT MATTERS:
If ΔL > 0: Bayesian provided more advance warning. If ΔL < 0: XGBoost provided more advance warning. If ΔL = 0: Both models warned at the same time.

CAVEATS:
Only includes episodes where BOTH models warned. Episodes where one or both never warned are excluded.
