FIGURE: Decision State Timeline
============================================================

WHAT IS SHOWN:
Binary alert states over weeks for a single district-year. Rows show outbreak weeks (cases above threshold), Bayesian alerts, and XGBoost alerts, computed from stored predictions and thresholds.

WHY IT MATTERS:
Shows how model alerts align with observed outbreak timing in a real district-year sequence.

CAVEATS:
Uses the first available outbreak episode in lead-time outputs. Thresholds come from the corresponding lead_time_detail_p*.csv.
