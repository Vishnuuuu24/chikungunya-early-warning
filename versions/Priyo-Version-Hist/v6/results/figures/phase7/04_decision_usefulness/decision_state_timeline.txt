FIGURE: Decision State Timeline
============================================================

WHAT IS SHOWN:
Timeline showing decision states (GREEN/YELLOW/RED) over weeks for Bayesian and XGBoost models. Each bar segment represents one week's decision state.

WHY IT MATTERS:
GREEN = normal operations, YELLOW = heightened surveillance, RED = outbreak response. State transitions indicate when public health action should change. More stable timelines (fewer transitions) are operationally preferable.

CAVEATS:
This is an illustrative example. Actual decision states require defined thresholds and operational rules.
