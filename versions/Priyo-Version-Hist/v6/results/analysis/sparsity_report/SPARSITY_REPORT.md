# Sparsity Report (v6)

## Dataset overview
- Total rows: 731
- Unique states: 21
- Unique districts: 195
- Year range: 2009–2022
- Labeled rows (`label_outbreak` not NaN): 101
- Positives among labeled: 43 (42.6%)
- Engineered feature columns (`feat_*`): 37
## Why folds fail (root cause)
Most fold failures are caused by *complete-case filtering* on engineered features. Many mechanistic/EWS features are undefined early in a district history (rolling windows, 52-week baselines), so dropping any row with any feature NaN collapses the dataset to almost nothing.
- Strict complete-case rows among labeled (require all 37 features): 8
- Strict complete-case rows using CORE feature set (require only 19 features): 77

## Biggest strict-completeness bottlenecks
`delta_if_drop_feature` tells you how many additional labeled rows you would recover if you *stopped requiring* that single feature to be non-NaN (holding all others fixed).
| feature | labeled_missing | delta_if_drop_feature |
| --- | --- | --- |
| feat_var_spike_ratio | 73 | 18 |
| feat_lai_lag_4 | 26 | 2 |
| feat_temp_lag_1 | 6 | 2 |
| feat_temp_lag_2 | 6 | 2 |
| feat_temp_lag_4 | 5 | 2 |
| feat_lai | 23 | 1 |
| feat_temp_anomaly | 6 | 1 |
| feat_lai_lag_1 | 26 | 0 |
| feat_lai_lag_2 | 23 | 0 |
| feat_rain_lag_1 | 7 | 0 |
## Thesis-consistent core feature set (recommended for sparse panels)
Use this for Track A baselines when you need stable CV. It preserves mechanistic + seasonal signal while avoiding long-baseline EWS features that are mostly undefined in this dataset.
Core set definition (`CORE_FEATURE_SET_V01`):
- feat_week_sin
- feat_week_cos
- feat_quarter
- feat_is_monsoon
- feat_lat_norm
- feat_lon_norm
- feat_lat_lon_interact
- feat_cases_lag_1
- feat_cases_lag_2
- feat_cases_lag_4
- feat_cases_ma_4w
- feat_cases_growth_rate
- feat_cases_var_4w
- feat_temp_lag_1
- feat_temp_lag_2
- feat_rain_lag_1
- feat_rain_lag_2
- feat_temp_anomaly
- feat_rain_persist_4w
- feat_degree_days
### Rationale (what we exclude and why)
- `feat_var_spike_ratio`: requires a long baseline (52 weeks) so it is missing for most district-years in a sparse panel.
- Long lags (e.g., `*_lag_8`) and long-window dynamics become undefined when district-year sequences are short or irregular.
- LAI lags are frequently missing due to upstream data gaps; treat them as optional or impute carefully.
