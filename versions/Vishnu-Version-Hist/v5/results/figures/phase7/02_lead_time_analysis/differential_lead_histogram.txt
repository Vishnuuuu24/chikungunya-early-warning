FIGURE: Differential Lead Time (ΔL) Distribution
============================================================

WHAT IS SHOWN:
Histogram of ΔL = L_XGB - L_Bayes for episodes where both models
triggered warning. Positive ΔL means Bayesian warned earlier.

DATA SPARSITY NOTE:
Low visual density reflects strict filtering: only episodes where
BOTH models warned are included (n=1 episode).
- Total episodes: n=4
- Both models warned: n=1 (Tumkur 2021, ΔL=0)
This extreme sparsity is methodologically correct—most episodes had
only Bayesian warnings (XGBoost never-warned rate: 75%).

WHY IT MATTERS:
- ΔL > 0: Bayesian provided more advance warning
- ΔL < 0: XGBoost provided more advance warning
- ΔL = 0: Both models warned at the same time

HOW TO INTERPRET:
With only 1 valid episode, this figure shows a single bar at ΔL=0.
This reflects that when XGBoost DID warn, it matched Bayesian timing.
The key insight is that XGBoost rarely warned at all (75% never-warned).

CAVEATS:
- Only includes episodes where BOTH models warned
- Single data point limits interpretation
- Never-warned comparison is more informative (see summary tables)
