# Chikungunya Early Warning System — Version 1

**Frozen:** 2026-01-26  
**Phase:** Baseline Models (Track A)  
**Status:** Complete

---

## Overview

Version 1 represents the first frozen milestone of the Chikungunya Early Warning System for India. This version includes baseline machine learning models trained on epidemiological and climate data to predict district-level outbreak risk.

## Models Included

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Random Forest | Ensemble of 100 decision trees with balanced class weights |
| Logistic Regression | L2-regularized linear classifier (C=0.01) |
| Threshold Rule | Simple μ + 2σ rule on lag-1 incidence |

**Note:** XGBoost was excluded due to macOS dependency issues (libomp). It may be added in future versions.

## Evaluation Protocol

- **Cross-validation:** Rolling-origin temporal CV (expanding window)
- **Test years:** 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 (2022 excluded due to insufficient samples)
- **Features:** 37 engineered features (case lags, climate, EWS indicators)
- **Valid samples:** 94 (after filtering for feature completeness)

## Results Summary

| Model | AUC | F1 | Sensitivity | Specificity | Brier |
|-------|-----|-----|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Random Forest | 0.719 ± 0.203 | 0.569 ± 0.165 | 0.590 | 0.707 | 0.218 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.666 ± 0.140 | 0.472 ± 0.312 | 0.466 | 0.786 | 0.231 |
| Threshold Rule | 0.604 ± 0.183 | 0.067 ± 0.133 | 0.040 | 0.971 | 0.355 |

### Interpretation

- **Random Forest** achieved the highest discriminative performance (AUC = 0.72), with moderate sensitivity (59%) and specificity (71%).
- **Logistic Regression** provides comparable performance with better interpretability.
- **Threshold Rule** exhibits high specificity but very low sensitivity, making it unsuitable as a standalone early warning trigger.

The observed variance across folds (AUC std 0.14–0.20) reflects the limited sample size and heterogeneity in outbreak patterns across years.

## Data Requirements

This version requires the processed features file:
```
data/processed/features_engineered_v01.parquet
```

This file is generated by running:
```bash
python experiments/02_build_features.py
```

## Reproduction

To reproduce v1 results from the project root:

```bash
cd versions/v1
bash run.sh
```

Or directly:
```bash
python experiments/03_train_baselines.py --config config/config_default.yaml
```

## Configuration

Key parameters from `config/config_default.yaml`:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Outbreak threshold | 75th percentile |
| Prediction horizon | 3 weeks |
| CV test years | [2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022] |
| Feature lookback | 12 weeks |
| Lags | [1, 2, 4, 8] weeks |

## Limitations

1. **Sample size:** Only 94 valid samples after filtering for feature completeness
2. **Temporal coverage:** Sparse data in later years (2020–2022)
3. **Spatial coverage:** Not all districts have sufficient historical data for EWS features
4. **XGBoost excluded:** Gradient boosting baseline not included in this version

## Next Steps (for future versions)

- [ ] Add XGBoost after resolving macOS dependencies
- [ ] Implement Bayesian hierarchical model (Track B)
- [ ] Compute lead time metrics
- [ ] Generate prediction plots and calibration curves
