FIGURE: Calibration Curves (Reliability Diagram)
============================================================

WHAT IS SHOWN:
Reliability diagram comparing XGBoost probabilities against observed outbreak frequency, alongside a Bayesian high-risk probability derived from latent Z summaries.

WHY IT MATTERS:
Points near the diagonal indicate good calibration. Deviations indicate over/under-confidence.

CAVEATS:
Bayesian curve uses P(Z > q80) (Normal approximation from z_mean/z_sd), which is a high-risk probability proxy rather than a direct posterior predictive outbreak probability.
