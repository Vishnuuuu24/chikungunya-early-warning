FIGURE: Decision State Timeline (ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE)
============================================================

WHAT IS SHOWN:
Timeline showing decision states (GREEN/YELLOW/RED) over 52 weeks for
Bayesian and XGBoost models. Each colored segment represents one week's
operational decision state.

ILLUSTRATIVE NOTE:
This figure shows SIMULATED state transitions for demonstration purposes.
Actual decision states would require:
- Defined risk thresholds for YELLOW/RED transitions
- Operational rules for state persistence and de-escalation
- Per-district prediction storage (not currently implemented)

WHY IT MATTERS:
- GREEN: Normal operations, routine surveillance
- YELLOW: Heightened surveillance, prepare resources
- RED: Outbreak response, deploy intervention teams
State transitions indicate when public health action should change.
More stable timelines (fewer transitions) are operationally preferable
as they reduce alert fatigue and resource churn.

HOW TO INTERPRET:
- Compare transition frequency between models
- Assess whether state changes align with actual outbreak timing
- Evaluate stability vs. responsiveness trade-off

CAVEATS:
- This is an ILLUSTRATIVE example with simulated data
- Actual implementation requires operational threshold definitions
- Decision layer specification in docs/Version 2/04_decision_layer_minimal_spec_v2.md
