FIGURE: Case Study Time Series
============================================================

WHAT IS SHOWN:
Two-panel case study for a representative district. Panel A shows observed cases and the outbreak threshold. Panel B shows XGBoost probabilities and a Bayesian high-risk probability derived from latent Z summaries.

WHY IT MATTERS:
Case studies illustrate how warning signals evolve relative to observed case escalation. Bayesian latent risk can provide a smoother trajectory; ML probabilities can respond sharply to feature patterns.

CAVEATS:
Bayesian probability here is P(Z > q80) using a Normal approximation from (z_mean, z_sd); it is not a direct posterior predictive P(outbreak).
