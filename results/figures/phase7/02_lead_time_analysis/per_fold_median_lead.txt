FIGURE: Median Lead Time by CV Fold
============================================================

WHAT IS SHOWN:
Bar chart comparing median lead time (in weeks) for Bayesian and XGBoost
models across each rolling-origin CV fold. Episode count (n) shown above
each fold pair.

DATA SPARSITY NOTE:
Low bar heights and zero values reflect real data limitations:
- 3 of 6 folds had zero detectable outbreak episodes
- Folds with outbreaks: 2017 (n=1), 2019 (n=1), 2021 (n=2)
- Many folds show 0 because models never warned (especially XGBoost)
This is methodologically correct—sparse outbreaks are expected in
Chikungunya surveillance data.

WHY IT MATTERS:
Fold-level variation reflects year-to-year differences in outbreak
patterns. Zero values indicate either:
- No outbreaks occurred in that test year, OR
- Model never triggered warning for outbreaks that did occur

HOW TO INTERPRET:
- Compare bar heights: higher = more advance warning
- 'n=0' above a fold means no outbreak episodes in that test year
- Zero-height bars for a model mean it never warned in that fold

CAVEATS:
- Folds with zero episodes show no bars (n=0)
- Models that never warned show 0 median (not missing data)
- Small n per fold limits statistical power
- See lead_time_summary_by_fold.csv for exact values
