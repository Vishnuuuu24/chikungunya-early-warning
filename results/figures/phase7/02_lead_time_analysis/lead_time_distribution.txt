FIGURE: Lead-Time Distribution: Bayesian vs XGBoost
============================================================

WHAT IS SHOWN:
Panel A: Histogram of lead times (weeks before outbreak) for episodes
where models triggered warning. Panel B: Box plot showing median, IQR,
and outliers. Only includes episodes where models warned.

DATA SPARSITY NOTE:
Low visual density reflects small number of outbreak episodes (n=4 total).
- Bayesian warned: n=3 episodes
- XGBoost warned: n=1 episode
This sparsity is REAL and reflects the strict episode-based evaluation
under fair analysis mode (symmetric p75 thresholds).

WHY IT MATTERS:
Positive lead time = model warned before outbreak started.
Higher lead time = more advance warning for public health action.
Bayesian model is designed to capture gradual risk escalation,
potentially warning earlier than binary classifiers.

HOW TO INTERPRET:
- Compare histogram heights between models
- Box plot shows median (center line), IQR (box), and outliers (whiskers)
- Bayesian mean lead time: 5.0 weeks
- XGBoost mean lead time: 0.0 weeks

CAVEATS:
- Episodes where model never warned (lead_time = -1) are excluded
- Small sample size limits statistical power
- See lead_time_summary_overall.csv for complete never-warned rates
