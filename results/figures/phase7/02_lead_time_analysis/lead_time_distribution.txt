FIGURE: Lead-Time Distribution: Bayesian vs XGBoost
============================================================

WHAT IS SHOWN:
Panel A: Histogram of lead times (weeks before outbreak) for episodes where models triggered. Panel B: Box plot showing median, IQR, and outliers. Only includes episodes where models warned.

WHY IT MATTERS:
Positive lead time = model warned before outbreak. Higher lead time = more advance warning. Bayesian model is designed to capture gradual risk escalation, potentially warning earlier than binary classifiers.

CAVEATS:
Episodes where model never warned (lead_time = -1) are excluded from these plots. See summary table for never-warned rates. SPARSE DATA reflects label generation challenge: 86% of panel rows excluded due to min_history=10 requirement for stable percentiles.
