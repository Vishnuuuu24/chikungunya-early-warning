FIGURE: Case Study Time Series (Placeholder)
============================================================

WHAT IS SHOWN:
This figure will show 2-3 case study districts with:
- Panel A: Observed case counts with outbreak threshold
- Panel B: Bayesian latent risk Z_t with crossing threshold
- Panel C: XGBoost probability P_t with 0.5 threshold
Vertical lines indicate first threshold crossings.

WHY IT MATTERS:
Case studies illustrate HOW the models detect outbreaks. Bayesian Z_t may rise gradually before cases spike, while XGBoost P_t may respond more abruptly.

CAVEATS:
Placeholder - requires per-district prediction storage. See experiments/08_case_study_plots.py for implementation.
