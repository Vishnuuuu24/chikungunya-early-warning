FIGURE: Case Study Time Series (PLACEHOLDER)
============================================================

PLACEHOLDER STATUS:
This figure is intentionally empty. It requires per-district prediction
storage which was not implemented in the current analysis pipeline.

WHAT WOULD BE SHOWN:
This figure would show 2-3 case study districts (e.g., Tumkur, Karnataka)
with three aligned panels:
- Panel A: Observed weekly case counts with outbreak threshold (p80)
- Panel B: Bayesian latent risk Z_t trajectory with warning threshold
- Panel C: XGBoost probability P_t trajectory with warning threshold
Vertical lines would indicate first threshold crossings for each model.

WHY IT MATTERS:
Case studies illustrate HOW the models detect outbreaks over time.
Bayesian Z_t may rise gradually before cases spike (early warning),
while XGBoost P_t may respond more abruptly to feature changes.
This visualization would demonstrate the lead-time advantage visually.

WHY IT IS NOT POPULATED:
- Current pipeline does not store per-district, per-week predictions
- Predictions are computed and evaluated in-memory during CV
- Implementation would require modifying 06_analyze_lead_time.py to
  save prediction trajectories for selected districts

FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION:
See experiments/08_case_study_plots.py (to be created) for implementation.
Candidate districts for case study: Tumkur (Karnataka) - has outbreak
episodes in 2017, 2019, and 2021 folds with varying lead times.
